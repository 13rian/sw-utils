I bought a dead mans suit
I didn’t get no change
I couldn’t take it back
For refund or exchange
I thought that it was black
I found out it was blue
Now I’m seeing things
That only dead men do

Well the arms are frayed
And the pocket’s burst
Since I got this suit
I got a dead mans curse
Now something’s changed
And I can’t go back
With this dead mans suit
Still on my back

Well I put it on
I thought that it was silk
It felt so smooth
Like it was lined with milk
Now all I’ve got
Is this sour taste
Like I‘ve lost something
That can’t be replaced

I bought a dead mans suit
I didn’t get no change
I couldn’t take it back
For refund or exchange
I thought that it was black
I found out it was blue
Now I’m seeing things
That only dead men do
